# Udemy Course: Server Side Rendering in React
https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=1383496


I didn't finished this course. I decided to follow tutorials / articles to rebuild my existing Create-React-App to SSR. This course is for "pure" React app, but I didn't want to eject from CRA bubble.


Finally I decided to make a new app with Next.js Framework :)
